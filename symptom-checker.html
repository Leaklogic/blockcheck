            <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-smog"></i>Smoke From The Exhaust</h3>
            <details>
                <summary>White Smoke</summary>
                <div class="details-content">
                    <p><strong>Is it a problem?</strong> A little puff of vapour on a cold morning is normal condensation. However, if you see continuous, thick white smoke after the engine has warmed up, it's a major warning sign.</p>
                    <p><strong>Your Next Step:</strong> A combustion leak test is essential. The LeakLogic kit will detect the exhaust gases that are pushing coolant out, confirming the diagnosis with a clear blue-to-yellow colour change. This is one of the most common signs we cover in our full <a href="/blog/7-signs-of-blown-head-gasket.html">guide to the 7 signs of a blown head gasket</a>.</p>
                </div>

                <summary>Blue or Grey Smoke</summary>
                <div class="details-content">
                    <p><strong>What it means:</strong> Blue or grey smoke indicates that engine oil is being burned. This can be caused by worn piston rings, valve seals, or in some cases, a head gasket that has failed between an oil passage and a cylinder.</p>
                    <p><strong>Your Next Step:</strong> A combustion leak test is still a valuable diagnostic step. If the test is positive (yellow), it suggests a complex head gasket failure. If it's negative (blue), you can rule out a coolant-related breach and focus on rings or seals.</p>
                </div>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Black Smoke</summary>
                <div class="details-content">
                    <p><strong>What it means:</strong> Black smoke means the engine is burning too much fuel (running "rich"). This is almost never a head gasket issue.</p>
                    <p><strong>Your Next Step:</strong> You do not need a head gasket test for this. Instead, investigate common causes like a clogged air filter, faulty fuel injectors, or a bad sensor.</p>

                    <p>If your engine is overheating but you're not sure why, check these common culprits first:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Low Coolant Level</li>

                    <p><strong>Your Next Step:</strong> If all of the above seem fine, the overheating is likely being caused by a head gasket leak. A combustion leak test is the most efficient way to confirm this.</p>

                        <li><strong>External Leak:</strong> You will see puddles of coloured fluid under the car, or visible drips from hoses, the radiator, or the water pump.</li>
                        <li><strong>Internal Leak:</strong> The coolant level drops, but you can't find any visible evidence of a leak. This is a strong sign the coolant is leaking *inside* the engine.</li>

                <div class="details-content">
                    <p>An internal coolant leak is a hallmark symptom of a blown head gasket. The coolant can escape into a cylinder and be burned off (causing white smoke) or leak into the oil (causing milky sludge). </p>
                    <p><strong>Your Next Step:</strong> If you suspect an internal coolant leak, a combustion leak test is the definitive diagnostic tool. It will confirm if exhaust gases are entering the cooling system through the same breach that coolant is escaping from.</p>

                <div class="details-content">
                    <p><strong>What it means:</strong> A creamy, tan sludge under the oil filler cap is a sure sign that oil and coolant are mixing. This only happens with a significant internal breach, and a blown head gasket is the most common cause.</p>
                    <p><strong>Your Next Step:</strong> Stop driving immediately. This is a critical symptom. A test will confirm the head gasket failure, but this visual sign is already a near-certainty of a major problem.</p>

                <div class="details-content">
                     <p>If you look in your coolant reservoir and see a dark, oily film floating on top, or the coolant itself looks like dirty sludge, it's a sign that engine oil is being forced into the cooling system.</p>
                    <p><strong>What it means:</strong> This happens when a head gasket fails between a high-pressure oil passage and a lower-pressure coolant channel. It's a clear sign of cross-contamination.</p>
                    <p><strong>Your Next Step:</strong> Like milky oil, this is a serious symptom. A combustion leak test is the best first step to confirm the head gasket is the source of the breach before you commit to a major repair.</p>

                <div class="details-content">
                    <p>The bubbles you see in the coolant tank of an overheating car are rarely the coolant actually boiling. It's usually high-pressure exhaust gas being forced into the cooling system through a head gasket breach. This process is called "gassing" and it violently displaces coolant and causes rapid overheating.</p>
                    <p><strong>Your Next Step:</strong> What you are seeing visually can be proven chemically. A LeakLogic test samples these exact bubbles. If they contain COâ‚‚ from combustion, the test fluid will turn yellow instantly, providing an undeniable diagnosis.</p>

                <div class="details-content">
                     <p>A head gasket that fails between two cylinders will cause a loss of compression, leading to a misfiring, shaking engine and poor performance.</p>
                    <p><strong>What it means:</strong> This can be caused by many things (spark plugs, ignition coils). A combustion leak test helps narrow it down. If the test is positive, the loss of compression is almost certainly related to the head gasket breach.</p>
                </div>

			<details>
                <summary>Engine Knock or Pinging</summary>
                <div class="details-content">
                    <p><strong>What it means:</strong> A metallic rattling or pinging sound, especially when accelerating, can be a sign of detonation. This happens when fuel ignites prematurely in the cylinder. Overheatingâ€”often caused by a blown head gasketâ€”creates hot spots that trigger this detonation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Your Next Step:</strong> Engine knock can cause serious piston damage if ignored. A combustion leak test is a crucial step to determine if the overheating that's causing the knock is due to a head gasket failure. If the test is positive, you've found the root cause.</p>
                </div>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>External Coolant or Oil Leaks</summary>
                <div class="details-content">
                     <p>Sometimes the gasket fails on an outer edge, causing coolant or oil to visibly weep from the seam between the cylinder head and engine block.</p>
                    <p><strong>What it means:</strong> A visual inspection is key here, but a combustion leak test is still wise. An external leak can often accompany a small internal leak, and confirming this gives you the full picture of the damage before starting repairs.</p>
