        <h1>The Ultimate DIY Pre-Purchase Car Inspection Checklist (UK)</h1>

      </header>

      <p>Buying a used car can be exciting, but it's also one of the biggest purchases you'll make. A shiny exterior can hide a multitude of expensive problems. This comprehensive checklist is designed to give you the confidence to inspect a car like a pro, helping you spot potential issues and avoid buying a lemon. Let's get started.</p>
      
      <h2>Section 1: The Exterior Check</h2>
      <h3>Bodywork and Paint</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Walk around the car in good daylight. Look for mismatched paint colours between panels, which can indicate a previous repair.</li>
          <li>Check for rust, especially on wheel arches, sills (below the doors), and the boot floor.</li>
          <li>Look down the sides of the car for ripples or dents.</li>
          <li>Check that all panel gaps (the lines between doors, bonnet, and wings) are even and consistent.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Tyres and Wheels</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Check the tread depth on all tyres – the legal minimum in the UK is 1.6mm.</li>
          <li>Look for uneven tyre wear, which could signal alignment or suspension problems.</li>
          <li>Inspect the alloy wheels for any major cracks or scuffs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Section 2: The Interior Check</h2>
      <h3>Electrics and Controls</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Test everything that uses electricity: windows, mirrors, radio, air-con, heaters, lights, and wipers.</li>
          <li>Turn the ignition on and check that all dashboard warning lights come on, and then go out once the engine starts. A light that stays on means a fault.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Wear and Tear</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Check the mileage on the odometer. Does the wear on the steering wheel, gear stick, and driver's seat match the displayed mileage?</li>
          <li>Lift the carpets to check for dampness, which could indicate a leak.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Section 3: Under the Bonnet</h2>
      <h3>Fluids and Leaks</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Check the engine oil level using the dipstick. The oil should be a light-brown colour, not black and sludgy.</li>
          <li>Check the coolant level in the expansion tank. It should be a bright colour (often pink, blue, or green) and not murky.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Single Most Important Engine Check</h3>
      <p>Here it is: the check that can save you thousands. A car can look perfect, but a hidden head gasket leak can turn your new purchase into a financial nightmare. Symptoms like overheating might not appear on a short test drive.</p>
      <p><strong>This is non-negotiable for a DIY inspection.</strong> Before you even start the engine for a test drive, use a combustion leak tester. It takes two minutes and gives you a definitive yes/no answer on the engine's health.</p>

      <h2>Section 4: Paperwork and History</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Check the V5C logbook. Does the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) on the document match the one on the car (usually at the base of the windscreen)?</li>
          <li>Review the MOT history online using the government's free service. Look for recurring advisories.</li>
          <li>Look through the service history. Has it been serviced regularly at reputable garages?</li>
      </ul>
